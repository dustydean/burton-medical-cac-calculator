## Input Sections

The calculator is organized into three logical sections accessible via tabs at the top.

### Tab 1: Business Basics

**Average Order Value ($)**
- Enter the average amount customers spend per order *before* taxes
- Include the full order value, not just profit
- Example: If customers typically spend $4,800 per order, enter 4800

**Tax Rate (%)**
- Enter your sales tax rate as a percentage
- If you pass taxes through to customers (they pay the tax), enter 0
- If you absorb the tax cost, enter your applicable rate
- Example: For 8.5% sales tax that you absorb, enter 8.5

**Return Rate (%)**
- Enter the percentage of orders that get returned, cancelled, or refunded
- Include all scenarios where you don't keep the revenue
- Example: If 0.5% of orders are returned, enter 0.5

**Cost of Sales as a Percent of Sales (%)**
- Enter your direct product costs as a percentage of revenue
- Include: product costs, manufacturing, materials, direct labor
- Exclude: shipping, marketing, overhead, salaries
- Example: If product costs are 63.7% of revenue, enter 63.7

### Tab 2: Customer Metrics

**Returning Customers (%)**
- Enter the percentage of first-time customers who make at least one additional purchase
- This is about repeat customer behavior, not just retention
- Example: If 2% of new customers become repeat customers, enter 2.0

**Repeat Order Rate (Lifetime)**
- Enter the average number of additional orders a returning customer makes
- Only count orders beyond their first purchase
- Example: If repeat customers average 1.2 additional orders, enter 1.2

**Fulfillment Cost Per Order ($)**
- Enter your average cost to package, ship, and deliver an order
- Include: packaging materials, shipping fees, handling labor

## Understanding Your Results

Results are organized into logical groups to tell the story of your unit economics.

### Revenue & Profitability Foundations

**Average Order Value (Post Tax/Returns)**
- Your actual revenue per order after accounting for taxes and returns
- This is the "real" revenue number for all other calculations

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** ‚≠ê *Key Metric*
- Total expected revenue from a customer over their entire relationship
- Based on initial order plus estimated repeat purchases
- Higher CLTV = more you can spend on acquisition

**Gross Margin %**
- Percentage of revenue remaining after product costs
- Shows the profitability of your core product offering

**Contribution Margin (Before Ad Spend)**
- Dollar amount each order contributes to fixed costs and profit
- Before any marketing/advertising expenses are deducted

**Operating Profit Per Order**
- Profit from each order after all costs except marketing
- The foundation for determining acquisition spending

**Customer Lifetime Profit** ‚≠ê *Key Metric*
- Total expected profit from a customer before acquisition costs
- This is your "budget" for acquiring customers

### Strategic CAC Targets

**Profit Driven CAC (New Customer)** ‚≠ê *Key Metric*
- Your target Customer Acquisition Cost for new customer campaigns
- Maximum you can spend to acquire a customer while hitting profit targets
- Use this number to set advertising budgets and evaluate channels

**Break-Even CAC**
- Maximum CAC where you break even (zero profit)
- Useful for understanding your absolute spending limits
- Always higher than your Profit Driven CAC

**LTV:CAC Ratio** ‚≠ê *Key Metric*
- Ratio of Customer Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost
- Healthy businesses typically maintain 3:1 or higher
- Higher ratios indicate stronger unit economics

### Lead Funnel Metrics

**Strategic CAC Target**
- Your Profit Driven CAC automatically populated from above
- This becomes the input for lead-based calculations

**Lead-to-Customer Conversion Rate (%)**
- Percentage of qualified leads that become paying customers
- Adjust this based on your actual funnel performance
- Higher conversion rates = higher allowable Cost Per Lead

**Tactical CPL Target** ‚≠ê *Key Metric*
- Your maximum allowable Cost Per Lead
- Use this to evaluate lead generation campaigns and channels
- Updates automatically when you change conversion rates

### Efficiency & Time-Based Metrics

**Profit Driven ROAS (New Customer)** ‚≠ê *Key Metric*
- Required Return on Ad Spend for profitable new customer acquisition
- For every $1 spent on ads, you need this much in lifetime revenue
- Use to evaluate campaign performance and set targets

**Estimated Payback Period**
- Number of orders required to recover your customer acquisition cost
- Helps understand cash flow timing and investment recovery
- Only appears when calculable (positive CAC and profit per order)

### Examples of Calculation Details

When you expand **Customer Lifetime Value**, you'll see:
```
Formula: AOV (Post Tax/Returns) √ó Average Orders Per Customer

Step 1: Average Orders = 1 + (Returning Customer % √ó Repeat Order Rate)
1 + (2.0% √ó 1.2) = 1.024 orders

Step 2: CLTV = AOV √ó Average Orders  
$4,776.00 √ó 1.024 orders

Result: $4,890.62
```

When you expand **Profit Driven CAC**, you'll see:
```
Formula: Customer Lifetime Profit - (Customer Lifetime Value √ó Target Net Margin %)

Calculation: $1,002.42 - ($4,890.62 √ó 12.0%)

Result: $415.55
```

## Waterfall Chart

### Understanding the Waterfall

The waterfall chart visually shows how your Average Order Value flows through costs to arrive at your net contribution margin.

**Reading the Chart**:
- **Starting Point**: Average Order Value (your revenue)
- **Subtractions**: Cost of Goods Sold, Fulfillment Cost, Customer Acquisition Cost
- **End Point**: Net Contribution Margin (what's left for profit and overhead)

**Bar Colors**:
- **Dark Blue**: Starting revenue (AOV)
- **Orange**: Cost deductions (COGS and Fulfillment)
- **Red**: Customer Acquisition Cost
- **Green**: Positive net margin
- **Red**: Negative net margin (warning sign)

**Key Insights**:
- **Tall green bar**: Strong unit economics
- **Short/red final bar**: Margin pressure, consider reducing costs or increasing prices
- **Relative bar sizes**: Shows which costs have the biggest impact

**Summary Metrics Below Chart**:
- **Starting Revenue**: Your total order value
- **Total Costs**: Sum of all cost components
- **Net Margin**: Profit remaining per order
- **Margin %**: Profit as percentage of revenue

## Best Practices

### Data Input Guidelines

**Be Conservative with Estimates**:
- Use realistic, not optimistic, projections
- Better to underestimate customer lifetime value than overestimate
- Conservative inputs lead to sustainable growth strategies

**Use Historical Data When Available**:
- Calculate actual AOV from past 6 months of orders
- Measure real return rates, not industry averages
- Track actual repeat purchase behavior

**Regular Updates**:
- Revisit calculations monthly or quarterly
- Update as business metrics improve or change
- Seasonal businesses should calculate for different periods

### Strategic Application

**Setting Marketing Budgets**:
- Use Profit Driven CAC as your maximum spend per customer
- Set campaign targets below this number to ensure profitability
- Different channels may have different CACs - compare against this benchmark

**Evaluating Channels**:
- Calculate actual CAC for each marketing channel
- Channels exceeding your Profit Driven CAC are unprofitable
- Focus budget on channels performing below your target CAC

**Growth Planning**:
- Higher LTV:CAC ratios indicate room for increased marketing spend
- Ratios below 3:1 suggest need for operational improvements
- Use break-even CAC to understand absolute limits

### Optimization Strategies

**If Your CAC is Too Low** (Limited marketing opportunities):
- Increase AOV through upselling or bundle offerings
- Improve customer retention and repeat purchase rates
- Reduce fulfillment costs through operational efficiency
- Consider premium pricing strategies

**If Your CAC is Too High** (Expensive to acquire customers):
- Reduce product costs through better sourcing or manufacturing
- Decrease G&A expenses where possible
- Lower target net margin temporarily to invest in growth
- Improve conversion rates to require fewer leads per customer

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: "Target net margin too high - CAC set to $0"
- **Cause**: Your profit target exceeds what's possible with current unit economics
- **Solution**: Lower your target net margin or improve your margins through cost reduction or price increases

**Problem**: Results show "N/A" for ROAS or LTV:CAC ratio
- **Cause**: Profit Driven CAC is $0, making ratios impossible to calculate
- **Solution**: Reduce target net margin or improve unit economics until CAC becomes positive

**Problem**: Payback period doesn't appear
- **Cause**: Operating profit per order is zero or negative, or CAC is zero
- **Solution**: Improve margins by reducing costs or increasing prices

**Problem**: Calculation details show unexpected results
- **Cause**: Input values may have decimal/percentage confusion
- **Solution**: Double-check that percentages are entered correctly (5% = enter "5", not "0.05")

### Data Validation

**Sanity Check Your Inputs**:
- Cost of Sales % + G&A % should be less than 100%
- Return rates above 10% warrant investigation
- Fulfillment costs should be reasonable relative to AOV
- Repeat order rates above 5 may be optimistic for most businesses

**Validate Against Reality**:
- Compare calculated LTV against actual customer behavior
- Check if calculated CAC aligns with current marketing performance
- Ensure gross margins match your accounting records

### Getting Help

**If Results Don't Match Expectations**:
1. Verify all inputs are in the correct units (dollars vs. percentages)
2. Check that you're using the right timeframe for repeat purchase calculations
3. Ensure you're including all relevant costs in the appropriate categories
4. Use calculation details to trace through the logic step-by-step

**For Business Strategy Questions**:
- Consider consulting with a financial analyst or marketing professional
- Review industry benchmarks for your specific business type
- Test different scenarios using the save/load functionality
